# Tasking Manager Login

The Tasking Manager is a seperate tool that coordinates mapping in to OpenStreetMap. However, it makes use of the OpenStreetMap login system. This means that you do not need to create a seperate user account to use the Tasking Manager, but you do need to create an OpenStreetMap account and login to OpenStreetMap before you can use the Tasking Manager for mapping.

When you first visit the Tasking Manager you will see a "Login" button in the upper right corner of the screen.

Clicking on that button will take you to the OpenStreetMap website. There you will have to login and grant the Tasking Manager access to your OpenStreetMap preferences. Create an account on the OpenStreetMap website if you do not already have one.

The Tasking Manager Contribute screen is divided into three main areas:

- Project Filters
- Project List
- Map View of Project List

### List Filters

By default all the projects available for mapping at your experiance level are displayed. You can use the Project List filters section of the screen to further narrow down the projects that you would like to work on.

- Project Number - If you know the number of the project you want to work on, you can enter it here and be taken directly to it.
- Organization - This allows you to just display projects that have been requested by individual organizations.
- Mapping Difficulty - Some projects are more difficult to map than others. This option allows you to find projects that are most appropriate for your experience level. You are encouraged to work on projects that best match your experience level, especially if you are a more experienced mapper.
- Type of Mapping - This allows you to find projects that include a certain type of feature to map. Many projects are focused on only one type of mapping, but projects may include multiple types of features to map.
- Full text search - This allows you to search for projects that may contain a certain word or phrase in the project description.
- Tags - Projects can have other tags that indicate some information not covered by any of the above, you can find projects by those tags by entering them into this field.

### Project List

The project list has two views, a Grid view (shown above) that shows some detailed information about the projects and a list view that shows more projects and is sortable by column headings.

### Map View
At the bottom of the screen is a map view. The points on the map are color coded, with red being urgent, yellow being high or medium priority and grey being low priority. Hovering over any of the points on the map will show information about that project. Clicking on any of the points on the map will take you to that project.
