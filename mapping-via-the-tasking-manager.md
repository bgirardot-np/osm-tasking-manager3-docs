The Tasking Manager is a seperate tool that coordinates mapping in to OpenStreetMap. However, it makes use of the OpenStreetMap login system. This means that you do not need to create a seperate user account to use the Tasking Manager, but you do need to create an OpenStreetMap account and login to OpenStreetMap before you can use the Tasking Manager for mapping.

When you first visit the Tasking Manager you will see a "Login" button in the upper right corner of the screen.

Clicking on that button will take you to the OpenStreetMap website. There you will have to login and grant the Tasking Manager access to your OpenStreetMap preferences. Create an account on the OpenStreetMap website if you do not already have one.
